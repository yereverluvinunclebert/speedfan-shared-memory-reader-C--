# speedfanreader
 
Written in C++, reads the shared memory area of Speedfan 4.5.2 and extracts the temperatures dynamically, original code by Christopher Vagnetoft. 
modified by Dean Beedell and Harry Whitfield.

Built using: 

Embaracadero Dev C++ 6.3

I use this program in conjunction with Speedfan 4.5.2 and my Steampunk CPU/GPU Thermometers widget that you can find here:

SpeedFan Information Tool 1.0
Retrieves temperature information from SpeedFan and outputs it to the console.

Note: This is probably the only sample available on the internet on how to
access SpeedFans shared memory using C++. Disturbing, isn't it?
